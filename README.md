## :clipboard: Page Purpose
This project is a simple “Linktree-style” page that acts as an aggregator for my social networks and other online projects. The page is responsive and was created as a digital business card, centralizing all my links in one place.

## :computer: Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## :bulb: Learnings
While building this project, I had the opportunity to improve my CSS skills. Key takeaways include:

- **Smooth Hover Transitions:** Using the `transition` property to create smooth, visually pleasing hover effects on buttons.
- **Responsive Layout:** Applying techniques to ensure the page adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Visual Effects with `backdrop-filter`:** Applying filters such as blur or brightness to elements that sit behind a specific element.
- **Colors with Transparency (`rgba`):** Using the `rgba` color model to set color opacity, enabling semi-transparent backgrounds and elements.
- **Semantic Structure:** Proper use of HTML tags like `<h1>`, `<h2>`, and `<p>` to structure content in an accessible, SEO-friendly way.
